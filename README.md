# SimpleInvoiceGenerator
My simple invoice generator I made for myself using google antigravity claude 4.5 model
The generator opens up via the default browser, everything is baked into 1 file (the .html one)
Icon is purely cosmetics, can be used when creating a shortcut to the main file, but any other icon will work (grabbed this one off a randomg website)

Note: im not a coder, idk anything about the code inside the file, antigravity/claude made everything, I just refined it to my likings
